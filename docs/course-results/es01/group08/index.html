                <p>We all know the amount of devices connected to the internet is increasing. From a smartwatch to a
                    smart thermostat that communicates with your phone to know when you are home, more and more objects
                    are communicating to each other. Understandably, many people nowadays use to term Internet of things
                    or IoT, but what does this actually mean?

                    <br><br>Lisa Elénius Taylor, head of IoT marketing for Ericsson, explained, "at the most basic
                    level, the Internet of Things is a network of devices, vehicles and appliances that have software
                    and connectivity capabilities". These "things" that can connect to a grid are able to exchange
                    information but in order to do so they need a name or an address recognised by all other members of
                    this grid. This address is a code called IP and in the infographic on this webpage it is shown how,
                    over the last decades, IPs spread over the world and how their current division is today.

                <p class="paragraph">The first version of IP was generally taken into use on 1982 and was called IPv4.
                    Its structure consists of 32 bits and allows for roughly four billion different addresses. The
                    Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns the IP addresses to the five different regions
                    called Regional Internet Registry (RIR). These regions manage the fair distribution based on
                    justified needs of the countries they represent and are more or less distributed like the
                    continents. Soon it became clear that the four billion IPs are not enough. Therefore its successor,
                    the IPv6 protocol was created and allows for 340 undecillion or 340 and 36 zeros. Although countries
                    have been adopting IPv6 since 1999, IPv4 remains the main protocol for internet use, that is why the
                    IPv4 provides an accurate insight in the current situation of connected devices. </p>

                <p class="paragraph">In the main graph all countries are presented sorted by the RIR they are part of.
                    For each country the amount of IPs is expressed over time by the thickness of their line. Although
                    their total amount is different, they are mapped from zero to their total amount being an equal line
                    width for every country. So the graph shows the relative growth proportional to a countries own
                    total. This change is accentuated by the circles as such that a peak in change, or high velocity, is
                    expressed in three different circles sizes according to the growth.

                    <br><br> In general one can see that there are two main periods where adoption was popular. In the
                    beginning of the nineties some early adoption countries gained a lot of IPs. The second wave of
                    adoption started around 2002 and lasted until with some RIRs being earlier or lasting longer than
                    others. Since the IPv4 were running out most countries changed to IPv6 in 2011. The last IPv4
                    addresses were allocated to RIR in 2011 and later divided over the countries. From the graph it is
                    visible that AFRINIC was the RIR with the most adoption after 2011.

                    true differences are enormous and range from around a thousand to a billion per country. In the
                    treemap the scale of the amount of IPs is put into perspective. As is clearly visible, the United
                    States cover the biggest area with Canada is second of that particular RIR taking just a small
                    portion and leaving the other countries invisible. The United States even has more IPs than most RIR
                    all together. LACNIC and AFRINIC contain way less IPs compared to the other regions. In the RIR RIPE
                    NCC the United Kingdom and Germany have about the same. Also Russia and the Netherlands have a
                    similar amount of IPs although Russia has a way higher population and country size. </p>

                <p class="paragraph">From the beginning, our intention was to show an overview of the connected devices
                    or "Internet of Things". However it is difficult to define which devices to include and which ones
                    not. Furthermore, the data about specific devices was often incomplete or not open source. There is
                    data available on the Internet Protocol addresses, showing when and how many IPs were assigned to
                    the various countries. We found a source that provides statistics from the official Regional
                    Internet Registries (RIRs): AFRINIC (Africa), APNIC (Asia-Pacific), ARIN (North America), LACNIC
                    (Latin America and Caribbean) and RIPE NCC (Europe). These statistics contain the number of IPv4 and
                    IPv6 addresses assigned and allocated. The data about the IPv6 was incomplete but as IPv4 is still
                    the most commonly used protocol it represents an insight in most connected consumer devices. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">In order to compare the different countries, which had a very different scale, the
                    data was normalised. For every country the minimum value was set as zero and the maximum value as
                    one, any value in between the minimum and maximum is converted to a value between one and zero. With
                    all countries mapped on an equal scale their respective growth could be compared. This method was
                    applied to the difference between the years, or their adoption, to highlight their differences. From
                    a distance, one can identify the major waves in IP adoption corresponding to the growth of the
                    internet. The individual countries show their behaviour towards the adoption of connectivity. </p>

                <p class="paragraph">The main focus of the visualisation is to provide an insight in the development of
                    connectivity thus IPv4 in the world. To show all countries and compare them it was necessary to put
                    them horizontally next to each other, forcing the time scale on the y axis. We decided to structure
                    the graph according to the real world distribution and therefore we divided the countries by their
                    RIR. This creates a clear visual structure and a natural grouping on geographical location. To
                    compliment the peaks in the graph, the line width grows along, being influenced by the peaks to
                    enhance the feeling of growth and direction. A countries starting point or first year of adoption is
                    clarified even more by a little T wedge breaking the line. After several experiments with arrows
                    other shapes the circles had the most clear and popping effect. Their density creates a clear
                    pattern, even from a distance. </p>
                <p class="paragraph">A treemap was added to the page to create a sense of proportion. The main graph is
                    not showing the difference in size between the countries because they are normalised. We have tried
                    several different methods to demonstrate this scale but the treemap prooved the most efficient, even
                    though many countries are too small to show up. In the legend one can read how many IP addresses a
                    5x5mm area of the treemap represents. To understand these big numbers, the reader can also compare
                    to the amount of people and the amount of connected devices in the world.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">With time on the X axis already being uncommon we decided to make the years
                    approach you. With the years going down, the total balance of the page with the weight of the
                    treemap on the bottom was better divided. We connected the graphs with a color scheme together with
                    a legend that also provides geographic information. The reader can find a general view regarding the
                    overall development for regions and their division over the world explore deeper levels of detail
                    and analyse different countries individually per year.</p>
