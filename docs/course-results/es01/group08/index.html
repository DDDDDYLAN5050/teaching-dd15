                <p>We all know the number of devices connected to the internet is increasing. From a smartwatch to a
                    smart thermostat that communicates with your phone to know when you are home, more and more objects
                    are communicating to each other. Understandably, many people nowadays use to term Internet of Things
                    or IoT, but what does this actually mean?
                    <br><br>Lisa Elénius Taylor, head of IoT marketing for Ericsson, explained, "at the most basic
                    level, the Internet of Things is a network of devices, vehicles and appliances that have software
                    and connectivity capabilities". These "things" that can connect to a grid are able to exchange
                    information but in order to do so they need a name, or an address recognised by all other members of
                    this grid. This address is called Internet Protocol version 4 or IPv4.

                    a sense of the difference in scale the final situation in 2019 is represented in a treemap. As

                    clearly visible, the United States cover the biggest area. Russia and the Netherlands have a

                <p class="paragraph">In general, one can see that there are two main periods where IP addresses were
                    popular. In the beginning of the nineties some early adoption countries gained a lot of IPs. The
                    second period started in the beginning of the zeroes. Soon it became clear that the four billion
                    possible addresses of IPv4 were not enough. Therefore, its successor, the IPv6 protocol was created
                    which allows for 340 undecillion or 340 and 36 zeros. The last IPv4 addresses were allocated to RIR
                    in 2011 and later divided over the countries. From the graph it is visible that AFRINIC was the RIR
                    with the most adoption after 2011. Although countries have been adopting IPv6 since 1999, IPv4
                    remains the main protocol for internet use, that is why the IPv4 provides an accurate insight in the
                    current situation of connected devices.
