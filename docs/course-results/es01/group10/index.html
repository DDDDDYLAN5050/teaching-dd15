                        The communication goal is to outline all the important milestones in the history of the Internet since 1945 to the present day.
                        This data cum information visualization focuses on the milestones that led to the establishment of the Internet as we
                        know it today, from its inception as an idea in the 1940s until the early 21st Century.
                        The varied and complex social and technological transformations we witness today have their roots in the
                        way the Internet has been developed.

                <div>
                        The milestones of Internet is classified under 4 different major categories, which are Technology/Product/Company/Events and highlighted by 4 different colors accordingly. These milestones are well connected to their countries/regions of origin.
                        All of these categories horizontally follow the basic timeline from 1945-2019 and has been simplified, and according to the density of milestones, the timeline has further divided by every single year to widely distribute the important milestones occurred throughout the time. Also, from the web generation perspective, the timeline has been classified as Web 1.0/Web 2.0 and Web 3.0.
