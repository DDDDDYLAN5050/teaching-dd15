        <p>Movies and TV series affect the way we perceive and experience the environment around us, they guide our thoughts. The entertainment world has always attracted people’s attention so is really interesting to analyze how the ‘fictional’ world of movies and TV series affects the real one. The research focuses on the effects of this phenomenon, and in particular on the way we perceive locations. Some aspects included in the research are: how we decide where we want to go when it comes to travel, what we want to see and how we take pictures. The topic is analysed with five research questions that cover some curious aspects of the theme. The answers that came out are interesting and, in some cases, unexpected. To obtain data were used tools such as Google Trends, social media (Instagram) and reviews platforms (TripAdvisor and Yelp), which show people’s direct point of view. From the research you can find out that city’s tourism increases in the years following the release of a movie or TV series, that people behave differently while taking photos in the filming locations, that movies and TV series related tours are popular activities that people do while visiting a city and the fact that the entertainment world has an influence on how we perceive places. Finally, the most creative finding is how some directors’ aesthetic influence the way people take pictures of locations.</p>

                <p> Nowadays visiting cities in which movies or TV series were filmed has become a trend. The aim of the research is to find out how much this phenomenon influences people’s travel interest. Starting from Google Trends data, the visualization shows, year by year, the change of interest in a city from 2004 until November 2019, highlighting the release years of films shot in the analysed locations. </p>

                <p> The common behaviour of going to movies and series locations to take photos has a specific name: setjetting in English and seichi junrei in Japanese. Since Instagram is the best platform for pictures, the visualization is based on the posts tagged with the hashtags #setjetting or #seichijunrei. It’s interesting the correlation between the photos’ different styles and the movie/series they refer to. </p>

                <p> As film tourism is getting more popular, film tours are becoming part of the central activities in cities where blockbusters were shot. It’s interesting to see what movies or TV series have created such a strong impact on people that they do activities connected to it. It's possible to see from the visualization how relevant film tours are in relation to all the available ones in each city. </p>

                <p> This topic was interesting to explore in order to discover how much movies and TV series affect our perception of certain locations. The aim is to show whether fictional places are more popular than their corresponding real ones and to compare famous movies/TV series’ influence. A good way to answer this question is to look on the most used platform for places reviews: TripAdvisor and Yelp. </p>

                <p> Some movies affect our interaction with the environment, even if we aren’t aware of it. The aim is to understand which are the directors that influence people to the point that they identify directors’ style in some peculiarities of landscape and spots. The categorization of photos collected on Instagram underlines which are the features of each director’s style that most influence people’s vision. </p>
