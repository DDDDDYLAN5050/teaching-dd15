    <div class="background"><div class="intro">
        <p>Online censorship consists of the control or the removal of certain contents that are accessible to the public. It exists because some governments and platforms want to <b>regulate content</b>. In particular, the latter’s <b>policies</b> are becoming more numerous and specific as the production of visual content grows exponentially. For example, Instagram counts 3600 new posts every second (edinet). The more the phenomenon involves users, the more it obtains relevance, becoming one of the most discussed topics: why are some contents censored? Who censors them? Which is the boundary between appropriate and inappropriate content? The research has been structured following three levels of depth to make this ambiguous and controversial phenomenon clearer. The first level explores the <b>types of censored content</b> and the different <b>visual languages</b> used to censor them. The second analyzes the <b>reactions</b> that censorship produces, both in terms of anti-censorship movements and of methods that users use to avoid it. Finally, the third investigates the most invisible aspect of the phenomenon: who is <b>working behind it</b>? The research shows how censorship is applied to images differently based on the typology of the platform and the content. This phenomenon can act silently, leaving the users unconscious, or other times it can be extremely evident, pushing them to search for ways to respond to or bypass it.</p>

                <p> Satellite technology allows to get images of every single angle of the world, and <b>Google Maps</b> lets users see them. However, on this platform, some locations appear <b>digitally obscured</b> intentionally, most of the time for reasons of national security, other times for <b>unclear reasons.</b> This is the reason why a map of the most mentioned places around the world censored on Google Maps was created. </p>

                <p> While available satellite images allow exploring all the places on Earth, they also show which of them have been censored. <b>Google Earth Pro</b>, unlike Google Maps, enables users to see <b>places timelines</b>, and how censorship is applied, despite there are no images of each year.

                <p> The border between artworks and explicit contents is sometimes blurred because censorship on social platforms is also applied to art; for example, the painting "The Origin of the World" was censored on Facebook for nudity.

                <p> Women are often at the centre of controversies regarding online censorship. Removed photos or deleted accounts are frequent, even if the community guidelines are respected. The cause is that some aspects of the <b>female body</b>, such as menstruation, are still not accepted.

                <p> <b>Instagram</b> is useful to increase brand awareness, but when the brands are <b>magazines</b> related to sensitive or erotic topics, they have to face its policy.
