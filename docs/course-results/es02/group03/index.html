    <div class="intro">
        <p>Memetic warfare can be defined as the strategic weaponization of memes, to <br />use these artefacts as <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xyvwdk/meme-warfare">Improvised Explosive Device of information warfare</a>. A meme, to mention Richard Dawkins, is a unit of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/meme">cultural information spread by imitation</a>. Spreadability, open-source materials, and environmental conditions provided by social networks enable almost everyone to create and spread these contents.</p>

<p>The term meme derives from the Greek mimema, which means “imitated”. This definition gives us the chance to re-evaluate the traditional concept of iconography. During the Renaissance, the symbolical power of images was a convention shaped by theologists and sovereigns and was framed into a rigid and hierarchical structure. <br />By contrast, nowadays the meaning of images and symbols is fluid, as the Internet broken topographic barriers and, apparently, created a decentralized ecosystem. Despite this, it is evident that context and shared conventions are still essential in order to evaluate the relevance of a meme into the information battlefield.</p>

<p>In this web report, we aim to describe the spread dynamics of memetic contents and their potential weaponization as a form of propaganda. We started checking the general awareness and the main sources of information available on Google, finding out that without being aware of memetic warfare, it’s difficult to come across the topic. Furthermore, the opinion of different typologies of content creators on the web it’s miscellaneous.</p>

<p>To see how memes can be turned into smart containers for viral ideas, we mapped their publication in specific channels like Reddit, Telegram and TikTok. Observing the different forms of contents we identified the protagonists of the online debate, the reasons for the choice of some formats to raise the awareness of a cause and the reaction of the active audience. In conclusion, our research shows that memetic warfare is no more a hypothetical practice as it has been implemented both by grassroots movements and political parties as part of complex and decentralized communication strategies.</p>

                    <p> In the first section of the research, we aim to verify if memetic warfare is considered relevant compared to the overall debate on memes. It is significant to make this test on Google since it’s one of the most used means of information. It appears evident that the sources that talk about memetic warfare are diluted into a stream of contents on the mainstream face of memes. </p>

                    <p> Starting from the findings of the first part we want to explore the different voices of the discussion about Memetic warfare. Considering the first 100 results on Google.it, different elements have been highlighted: the sources’ opinions, the type of text and the point of view. It emerges that the three main types of sources are linked to radically different opinions about Memetic warfare. </p>

                    <p> The aim of this step of the research is to map the words used in texts related to memetic warfare since these words represent alternative search terms that can lead the users to this topic. The resulting set of words is formed by one-words and two-words strings. The analysis reveals a debate oriented to define theoretically the phenomenon into the context of recent and significant events. </p>

                    <p> Telegram, being a peer-to-peer encrypted channel, allows the free circulation of contents. This is an essential feature that allows people to communicate without surveillance. Starting from this premise, sample packs related to Pepe the frog were analysed and clustered in order to map how the basic format of this meme are declined in many variants to share different ideologies. </p>

The examined contents are contextualised into a particular event: the 2019 Hong Kong Protests.

                    <p> The final part attempt to analyze the phenomenon of memification of music and video, as happened a few years ago on Vine. Although TikTok prohibits politics, it is interesting to analyze how an institutional figure (former Minister of the Interior) uses it in a controversial way, talking about this topic. Furthermore, it is interesting to analyse the users’ reactions to this approach. </p>
