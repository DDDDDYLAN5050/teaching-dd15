<p>During the 2017 London Bridge attack, while people were trying to escape from the area, prices of Uber races began to rise, until they doubled their normal price. Many people were outraged: what until then had been an accepted mechanism (more demand, higher prices) suddenly proved unacceptable. The choice of price was not managed by human beings, but by an algorithm, and in a short time it was disabled.</p>
<p>This is just one example of how digital platforms that now pervade our community, by mediating our access to information, generate sometimes unexpected results that challenge social conventions. It also represents just the tip of the iceberg, the most explicit evidence of the radical and widespread impact that information and communication technologies - particularly the Internet and the Web - have on society.</p>
<p>While in the last decade the concerns were mainly user-centered, thinking mainly to the outcome for the individual (e.g. privacy loss), in the last few years we have seen how all these technologies are having consequences on society as a whole. Home sharing services are reshaping the real estate market, and perhaps cities. Social networks have been tweaked to influence and push propaganda in the democratic processes, or misused to organize mobs against minorities. Biometrics data, useful for unlocking the screen of our phones, brings also racial biases. Self-Driving cars, approaching in the near future, will impact on urbanization as well.</p>
<p>These issues do not have clear and unambiguous solutions and generate dense and complex debates that interweave alliances and oppositions, involving many different actors through digital conversations. At a first analysis the situation stalls: complexity, by definition, is impossible to reduce without losing its wealth; at the same time, it remains incomprehensible without its simplification. As communication designers we can - and we should - contribute to the understanding of these phenomena and orienting possible (re)actions. As complex and controversial problems can not be faced by a single actor, we can represent and share the debate that defines and nourishes them so that any stakeholder can find its own position.</p>
<p>The studio-course is structured in different phases, on a path that explores different dimensions of data analysis, information and communication design. Students will start by representing the theme using structured data and information produced and shared by reputable sources, designing a first visual synthesis. At this stage, to ensure a correct relationship with the data, statistical notions and tools are introduced. In the second phase we will focus on the debates that feed the controversies around the selected topics by using unstructured data and information produced and shared by non-institutional organizations, communities, collective entities or individuals and activists via the Internet. Finally students will design a (data) experience with the aim of engaging a broad public in understanding the complexity of the issues at hand.</p>
<p>The different phases of the course require to identify the most suitable communication languages and tools, both digital and physical, to exploit their specific potential and to synthetize all the competences acquired.</p>
<p>Transversally, the concepts of social complexity, the role of statistics tools and methods in the visualization process, and the idea of visualization as intersemiotic translation - such as narrative and discourse - will be deepened. The &quot;visual discourse&quot; in its various forms of manifestation will be then considered as an argumentative strategy, in which narration and dramatization complement the direct communication of data and information. Rhetorical-argumentative figures, in particular those based on analogy and metaphor, will be applied - consistently with the different design moments of the lab - as both knowledge tools and communicative devices, exploiting the potential for facilitating access to cognition.</p>
<h1 id="objectives">Objectives</h1>
<p>At the end of the course, the students will have learned:</p>
<ol>
<li>Knowledge in the data visualization, information visualization, information design disciplines, and the role of communication design;</li>
<li>Knowledge and use of the visual variables and application of communication design to visualization of data and information;</li>
<li>Knowledge on tools for data manipulation (Excel, OpenRefine) and for the creation of visual structures (RAWGraphs, Gephi);</li>
<li>Knowledge on data harvesting/scraping (Web Scraper Chrome Extension) and data collection through APIs;</li>
<li>Understanding basic statistics and software for their application (R);
Knowledge of the rhetorical-argumentative figures (especially those based on analogy and metaphor).</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="course-structure">Course structure</h1>
<p>The course will be divided into three main phases in which students will be working in groups. In addition, every student will be challenged with two individual assignments.</p>
<p>Students will be introduced to the information design and data visualization domain through iterations of a set of interrelated activities: picking appropriate sources, constructing a coherent narrative, dealing with unstructured data, communicate, share and engage by designing for advocacy.</p>
<p>The three phases have different goals and outputs, giving students the chance to experiment on how to design visualizations for different kinds of purposes and publics.
The supporting themes, tackled from a different perspective in each phase, are: the role of the designer as an author, data handling and its implications, the rhetorical value of data visualization.</p>
<h1 id="first-phase-data-as-material">First phase: Data as Material</h1>
<h3 id="creating-an-infographic-from-reputable-official-sources">Creating an infographic from reputable official sources</h3>
<p>In this phase students will be asked to identify datasets available from official sources (Eurostat, governmental open data portals, scientific publications, etc.) and from those they will have to design visualizations to provide an overall view, “institutional” of the chosen issue.</p>
<p>The first phase will tackle data handling and translation for the creation of visualizations; highlighting the theoretical and technical competences needed. It will acquaint students with how to work with data in a tabular format (cleaning, aggregation, lookup).
There will be a basic introduction to Statistics, defining its objectives and highlighting why an information designer needs to master it. Traditional methods from the design field will be used in order to analyze and represent complex datasets. This module will also provide students with the basic theories of data visualization, following its development and core principles.</p>
<p>Output of this phase is the design of a series of visualizations - both for a web format and a printed edition - that represent a first perspective or angle to access the chosen issue.</p>
<h1 id="second-phase-data-as-artifact">Second phase: Data as Artifact</h1>
<h3 id="visualizing-controversies-collecting-data-from-the-web">Visualizing controversies collecting data from the Web</h3>
<p>In the second phase of the course each group analyze their topic using digital methods. Digital methods are “techniques for the study of societal change and cultural condition with online data” (Rogers, 2019). Here, students learn how to map a controversial issue by collecting, analysing, and visualising data from online sources (e.g. search engines and social media platforms).</p>
<p>The process is question-driven: from research questions, students design protocols for data collection and analysis, and produce research findings using data visualizations. At the same time, students are also asked to trace and make explicit their process by designing protocol diagrams: flowcharts presenting research questions and research steps in a compact visual form (Niederer and Colombo, 2019).</p>
<p>At the end of this phase, each group design and deliver an interactive research report and present it to the class. The research report is a visual atlas (Venturini et al., 2015) of the issue under study according to the web: a mapping of the issue resonance, sources, actors, textual and visual language in different spaces of the web.</p>
<h2 id="learning-goals">Learning goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>to demarcate spaces on the web through <em>query design</em>;</li>
<li>to <em>repurpose</em> online digital objects (e.g. links, likes, shares, timestamps) for research;</li>
<li>to critically reflect on <em>data collection as a design activity</em>;</li>
<li>to use <em>data visualization as a tool</em> in the research process.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="third-phase-data-publics">Third phase: Data Publics</h1>
<p>In this phase, students will turn the research carried out in phase 2 into a discursive communication artifact that exposes, evidences or makes known the critical aspects of the subject to a specific public. Discursive communication artifacts exposes ideas (discourses) “capable of conveying complex perspectives and confronts conflicting values” (Tharp, B. &amp; Tharp, S, 2018) of the subject with the aim of having audiences reflect and act on them.</p>
<p>Students are motivated to reflect on what the “public” means, how different groups are mobilised around various issues (DiSalvo, 2009) and how data might play a central role in the process of public formation. Students are also asked to recognize the political role of their design practices with technology and how they impact society.</p>
<p>The aim is for students to apply their communication design skills using data for building alternative narratives (Briones, 2019) that expose, explain and/or explore their research findings. Students are asked to delve into one or more of the research findings identified in the previous phase, and to design and craft a highly experimental digital artifact (i.e: interactive report or documentary, virus, plug-in, guides and kits) that is usable by a specific audience to act on the issue. The final deliverable is a website that contains the communication artifact.</p>
<h1 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h1>
<p>Personal evaluation will be based on the outcome of the three group deliveries (which will be the main component), the outcome of the personal exercises, the active involvement in the team work and in the classroom.
Each group delivery will be evaluated in different aspects, and the final mark will be an average of them. Since each delivery is part of a broader teaching path, the mark will be expressed in letters, representing a range of marks (A: 29-30L, B: 26-28, C 23-25, D: 19-22, E:18). In the following paragraphs, the evaluation aspects for each delivery will be listed.</p>
