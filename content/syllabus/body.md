# Objectives
At the end of the course, the students will have learned:
- Knowledge in the data visualization, information visualization, information design disciplines, and the role of communication design;
- Knowledge and use of the visual variables and application of communication design to visualization of data and information;
- Knowledge on tools for data manipulation (Excel, OpenRefine) and for the creation of visual structures (RAW, Gephi);
- Knowledge on data harvesting/scraping (Web Scraper Chrome Extension) and data collection through APIs;
- Understanding basic statistics and software for their application (R);
Knowledge of the rhetorical-argumentative figures (especially those based on analogy and metaphor).

# Course structure
The course will be divided in three main phases in which students will be working in groups. In addition every student will be challenged with an individual assignment.

Students will be introduced to the information design domain through iterations of a set of interrelated activities: picking appropriate sources, constructing a coherent narrative, dealing with unstructured data, communicate, share and engage by designing for advocacy.
The three phases have different goals and outputs, giving students the chance to experiment on how to design visualizations for different kinds of purposes and publics.

The supporting themes, tackled from a different perspective in each phase, are: the role of the designer as an author, data handling and its implications, the rhetorical value of data visualization.

# 1. Data as Material
In this phase students will be asked to identify datasets available from official sources (Eurostat, governmental open data portals, scientific publications, etc.) and from those they will have to design visualizations to provide an overall view, “institutional” of the chosen issue.

The first phase will tackle data handling and translation for the creation of visualizations; highlighting the theoretical and technical competences needed. It will acquaint students with how to work with data in a tabular format (cleaning, aggregation, lookup).
There will be a basic introduction to Statistics, defining its objectives and highlighting why an information designer needs to master it. Traditional methods from the design field will be used in order to analyze and represent complex datasets. This module will also provide students with the basic theories of data visualization, following its development and core principles.

Output of this phase is the design of a series of visualizations - both for a web format and a printed edition - that represent a first perspective or angle to access the chosen issue.

# 2. Data as Artifact
In the second phase of the course each group analyze their topic using digital methods. Digital methods are “techniques for the study of societal change and cultural condition with online data” (Rogers, 2019). Here, students learn how to map a controversial issue by collecting, analysing, and visualising data from online sources (e.g. search engines and social media platforms).

The process is question-driven: from research questions, students design protocols for data collection and analysis, and produce research findings using data visualisations. At the same time, students are also asked to trace and make explicit their process by designing protocol diagrams: flowcharts presenting research questions and research steps in a compact visual form (Niederer and Colombo, 2019).

At the end of this phase, each group design and deliver an interactive research report and present it to the class. The research report is a visual atlas (Venturini et al., 2015) of the issue under study according to the web: a mapping of the issue resonance, sources, actors, textual and visual language in different spaces of the web.

## Learning goals
1. to demarcate spaces on the web through *query design*;
2. to *repurpose* online digital objects (e.g. links, likes, shares, timestamps) for research;
3. to critically reflect on *data collection as a design activity*;
4. to use *data visualisation as a tool* in the research process.

## Evaluation criteria
### Data visualisation
Efficiency and clarity of data visualizations, including protocol diagrams. Are the designed visualisations functional to answer the research questions? Are the protocol diagrams clear and self explanatory?

### Research method
Innovation and robustness of research protocols, including query design. Is the designed research method functional to answer the research question? Is there innovation in repurposing digital objects for answering research questions?

### Research findings
Clarity in the communication of research findings, including images and text. Are research findings understandable by looking at the visualisations? Are research findings clearly described in the text?

## Output
Interactive research report. Examples from previous years:

# 3. Data Publics
Based on previous research (phases 1 and 2), in phase 3 each group will design a digital communication artifact that deliberately entails ideas (discourses) capable of sustaining complex perspectives and confronts conflicting values of a research finding, with the immediate objective of having audiences reflect and act on them. Discursive design focus on “tools for thinking; they raise awareness and perhaps understanding of substantive and often debatable issues of psychological, sociological, and ideological consequence” (Tharp, B. & Tharp, S, 2018). The aim is to transform a research finding into a discursive artifact that promotes reflection on the subject by means of repurposing the studied digital objects (links, bots, trackers, etc), technological media (platforms, etc), and their logics (share, like, feeds, etc). For this, students will use the data and research conducted in phase two, focusing on one of the findings.

In the first place, discursive artifacts are containers of ideas that invite reflection; at the same time they are artifacts that can be used. The artifact is the mediator between action and reflection.

Here, students learn how to

## Learning goals
1. *to create* discursive artifacts that prompt to reflection and action over a research finding
2. *experiment* with digital objects for creating digital discursive artifacts
3. *define* a message
4. *identify* the audience and context of …
5. *to repurpose* data and data visualization as components of discursive artifacts

## Evaluation criterias

## Reference

# Individual deliveries
To better evaluate students, in addition to the group exercises two individual deliveries will be required for the final exam. These exercises will be introduced during the Statistics and Semiotics modules in the course. Each one will be then evaluated by the professor.

## Statistics: Ex-tempore
Objective of this personal assignment is the presentation of a statistical analysis based on the notions learned during the module. Starting from a dataset, students will be required to frame a problem, analyse data and present results.

## Semiotics: Infopoetry
Objective of the assignment is the design of a defined “artifact” (without limits of languages and materials) in which students will experiment a poetic approach to the representation of data. The objective is to make people “feel” the phenomenon behind the data and not only “see” the data.

# Modules and professors
The course is composed by five modules, representing the different competencies needed to train students in the information design field. The course is coordinated by professor Paolo Ciuccarelli. The modules will be presented in parallel in order to provide all the necessary skills needed for a proper approach to the three phases.
Four teaching assistants will support professors during feedback sessions and students in the development of the projects.
