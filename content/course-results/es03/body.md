In the second phase of the course students learn how to make use of online data to study social and cultural phenomena: in a question-driven process, each group design protocols for data collection and analysis and produce research findings using data visualizations. At the end of the phase each group design an interactive research report.

Each designed report analyzes a specific issue: memetic warfare, visual misinformation, dating and fake profiles, face recognition and its countermeasures, deep fakes and synthetic media, the effects of digital platforms on the visual representation of cities, visual censorship online, drones and aerial mapping, apps for face and body modifications.

In all, they offer a critical overview of how digital technologies are blurring the boundaries between real and fake.
