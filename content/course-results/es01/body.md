In the first part of the course, students collectively work to create an "Atlas of the Internet" from various perspectives, providing a comprehensive overview of how the internet works, how it's used and its history through the decades.

The results are a collection of ten printed visualizations, one per group, tackling the complex shape and nature of the internet.
