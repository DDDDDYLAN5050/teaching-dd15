The 2019/2020 edition of DensityDesign final synthesis studio focused on learning to observe and *represent controversial phenomena* from *different perspectives*, and to *visually communicate them to different publics*.

Starting from the main topic of *ubiquitous technologies challenging the status quo* and affecting the fabrics of our society, students are challenged to identify peculiar points of view to analyze in *three phases of research*.

In this context, Communication Design is used to access and *understand the increasingly complex amount of data and information* shaping our world. Students are invited to use visualisation techniques across multiple phases of the research process:

1. *Data Representations*, where data visualization is used as a tool to analyze and understand the observed phenomena;
2. *Data Artifacts*, where digital traces and unstructured informations become touch points for identifying discourses worthy of being analyzed, organized and then shared in a digested format;
3. *Data Publics*, where a newly constructed awareness shapes action on a context to build publics and form new ways of thought through information design.

Within the Final Synthesis Design Studio converge competences and tools developed into the DensityDesign research lab. With data visualization as the main language, it evolves as a communication and narration device as well as a way to share knowledge, methods and results.
